What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.

What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to analyze various factors of data. Deep learning is particularly useful for processing unstructured data such as images, text, and audio.

What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics.

What is Computer Vision?
Computer Vision is a field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects and then react to what they "see."

What is Reinforcement Learning?
Reinforcement Learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. It differs from supervised learning in that correct input/output pairs need not be presented, and sub-optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected.

What is a Neural Network?
A Neural Network is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. It consists of artificial neurons that transmit signals to other neurons, with each connection having a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds.

What is Transfer Learning?
Transfer Learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It's popular in deep learning because it allows us to train deep neural networks with comparatively little data.

What is Generative AI?
Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate new content, such as text, images, audio, or video, that resembles human-created content. Examples include GPT models for text and DALL-E for images.

What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines information retrieval with text generation. It enhances large language models by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources before generating responses, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations.
